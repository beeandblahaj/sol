# Welcome to the Sol Terminal!
An interactive reading database made in C++, featuring original stories, online works (AO3 or Wanderer's Library), and more.

## Customization Options:

The "Text" folder is dedicated to user config files.

!config.txt dictates all customization options for the terminal.
!help.txt is an in-terminal guide for the !config.txt file.

### !config.txt Guide:
